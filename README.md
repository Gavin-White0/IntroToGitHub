# IntroToGitHub
Version control summary: Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing users to manage and revert to previous versions. 
It is widely used in software development, where teams need to collaborate efficiently on the same codebase without overwriting each other's work. 
By saving snapshots (or commits) of a project at various stages, version control ensures that every change is documented and can be referenced or undone if necessary.
